# [TrashWizard](https://trashwizard-10850.firebaseapp.com/)

The goal of the app is to provide an interface to aid consumers properly dispose garbade, recycling, organics and other items according to the standard set out by City of Toronto's waste management team.

- Serverless Progressive Web App (PWA) written with Angular as the frontend, and all the data is stored locally so the application can be scaled easily while still providing a fast look up time
- The app was created as a sustainable project for ConUHacks IV
